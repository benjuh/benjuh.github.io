        <p class="support">We've noticed that there are too many incidents and not enough police. That's why I took it
          upon myself to allow the community to report incidents amongst themselves and deal with the incidents that are
          a little less serious. We are currently tracking data with a test community to se if this app will yield lower
          crime rates as the app is used.</p>

        <p>Effective Date: 05/18/2023</p>

        <p>This Privacy Policy explains how Stewart Security ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and discloses
          information when you use our iOS mobile application (the "App"). By downloading and using the App, you consent
          to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <p>1. Information We Collect</p>

        <p>1.1 Personal Information: We may collect personal information that you provide to us, such as your name,
          email address, and other contact information when you register or communicate with us through the App.</p>

        <p>1.2 Usage Information: We may automatically collect certain information about your use of the App, including
          your device type, operating system, app version, IP address, and other statistical data.</p>

        <p>2. How We Use Your Information</p>

        <p>2.1 Provide and Improve the App: We use the information we collect to operate, maintain, and enhance the
          functionality of the App, customize your experience, and respond to your inquiries and requests.</p>

        <p>2.2 Communication: We may use your contact information to send you important updates, promotional offers, or
          other relevant information about the App. You can opt-out of receiving these communications at any time.</p>

        <p>2.3 Analytics: We may use third-party analytics tools to analyze usage patterns of the App. This helps us
          understand how users interact with the App and improve its performance and features.</p>

        <p>3. Information Sharing</p>

        <p>3.1 Service Providers: We may engage third-party service providers to perform certain functions on our
          behalf, such as hosting, data analysis, and customer support. These providers have access to your information
          solely for the purpose of performing these tasks and are obligated to maintain its confidentiality.</p>

        <p>3.2 Legal Requirements: We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid
          legal requests, such as subpoenas or court orders.</p>

        <p>4. Data Security</p>

        <p>We take reasonable measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or
          destruction. However, please note that no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is
          100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, we
          cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

        <p>5. Children's Privacy</p>

        <p>The App is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 17. We do not knowingly collect personal
          information from children. If we discover that we have inadvertently collected personal information from a
          child, we will promptly delete it.</p>

        <p>6. Changes to this Privacy Policy</p>

        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes by posting
          the updated Privacy Policy within the App or by other means of communication. Your continued use of the App
          following the changes will signify your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy.</p>

        <p>7. Contact Us</p>

        <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or our data practices, please contact us at
          unified.app.help@gmail.com.</p>
